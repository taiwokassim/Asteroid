# Asteroid Game

## Description
I created an asteroid game where the player controls a spaceship in open space and must survive by destroying or avoiding incoming asteroids. The spaceship can move freely in all directions and fire shots to break large asteroids into smaller fragments until they disappear. As the game progresses, more asteroids appear and move faster, making survival increasingly challenging. The main objective is to survive as long as possible while achieving the highest score.

## Features
- Spaceship movement in all directions  
- Shooting mechanics to destroy asteroids  
- Asteroids split into smaller fragments when hit  
- Increasing difficulty as the game progresses  
- Score tracking system  

## How to Play
1. Launch the game.  
2. Use the controls to move your spaceship.  
3. Avoid or shoot the asteroids.  
4. Stay alive as long as possible to earn a higher score.  

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys / WASD** → Move spaceship  
- **Spacebar** → Shoot  

## Future Improvements
- Add power-ups (shields, rapid fire, etc.)  
- Multiplayer mode  
- Different spaceship skins  
- Background music and sound effects
