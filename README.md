# Asteroid
I created an asteroid game where the player controls a spaceship in space and must survive by destroying or avoiding incoming asteroids. The ship can move in all directions and shoot to break the asteroids into smaller fragments until they disappear. The main objective is to last as long as possible while achieving the highest score.
